Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. Use Angular's built-in directives to manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see.

The different types of Angular directives are :

- Components: Used with a template. This type of directive is the most common directive type.
- Attribute directives:	Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
- Structural directives: Change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
